# Usage

## Get started

Upon the first launch of the application, you will find that there are already some initial questions available for you to manage. They are provided as examples to help you get started quickly.

![initial_questions](https://github.com/What-the-Flutter/survey_sdk/assets/94079414/bf8abee3-1a18-4352-b0bd-fd462c824127)

You can explore these questions, view their structure, and modify them according to your needs.

## Question Creation

Upon creating a new question, you will be presented with a preview of how the question will appear. This preview allows you to visualize the question and its associated widget configuration in real-time, helping you make informed decisions about its customization.

In addition to the preview, the application offers a set of basic settings that you can adjust to tailor the question to your specific requirements. By modifying these settings, you can fine-tune the question and its widget configuration to match your desired survey design and functionality.
