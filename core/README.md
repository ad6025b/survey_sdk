1.  Clone the GitHub repository into your local environment.

2.  Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

        flutter pub get

3.  Import the Activity SDK into your Flutter application by including it in your pubspec.yaml file:

        dependencies:
          survey_sdk: ^0.0.1

4.  Start using the Activity SDK in your Flutter application.

## Features üí°

The Activity SDK offers a range of customizable widgets and components that can be used to integrate surveys and feedback mechanisms into your Flutter application with ease. Some of the key features include:

- ‚öôÔ∏è Customizable survey forms with a range of different question types.

- üñ•Ô∏è A variety of feedback mechanisms, including in-app feedback forms, email feedback forms, and more.

- üßø Integration with popular analytics platforms such as Google Analytics and Firebase Analytics.

- üåê Support for internationalization/localization, allowing you to support multiple languages and locales.

- üñ®Ô∏è You can also export or import the created survey to a json file in the admin package.

- üñåÔ∏è Survey theme customization (background color, font styles, button colors, etc.).

## Survey

A widget that renders a survey form. It manages the state of the survey and renders the appropriate widgets based on the survey state.

The survey form is defined by either a `filePath` parameter or a `surveyData` parameter. The `filePath` is the path to a JSON file containing the survey data, while the `surveyData` parameter is the survey data itself.

Either `filePath` or `surveyData` must pe provided. Also there is a `controller` parameter that is optional and can be used to provide a custom survey controller.

# Example of usage

```dart
 @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text('Survey example'),
      ),
      // Add Survey to your widget tree with filePath parameter that accepts
      // a json file with parsed survey data
      body: const Survey(filePath: 'assets/questions.json'),
    );
  }
```

You can see a full example [here](example/).

## SurveyData

Holds the core survey data used in the whole app, including the list of questions and the common theme.
